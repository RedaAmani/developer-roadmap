# Dialogs

A `DialogFragment` is a special fragment subclass that is designed for creating and hosting dialogs. Although you don't need to host your **dialog** within a fragment, doing so lets the `FragmentManager` manage the state of the dialog and automatically restore the dialog when a configuration change occurs.
