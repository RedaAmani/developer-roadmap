# Basics of OOP

Understanding the `Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` is crucial. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses "Objects" - entities that contain both data and functions that manipulate the data.

Key concepts include `Classes`, which are blueprints from which objects are created; `Objects`, instances of a class; `Inheritance`, where one class acquires properties from another; `Polymorphism`, the ability of an object to take many forms; `Abstraction`, showing only necessary details and hiding implementation from the user; and `Encapsulation`, the concept of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
