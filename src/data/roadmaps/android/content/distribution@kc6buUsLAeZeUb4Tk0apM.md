# Distribution

Distribution in Android refers to the methods and channels you can use to get your Android application into the hands of users. You can choose to distribute your app on the Google Play Store, which is the official app store for the Android operating system. This platform makes your app available to users in various countries around the world. Additionally, you can also opt to distribute your app through other third-party app stores or even your own website. Furthermore, Google provides a range of distribution options such as country targeting, device targeting, and staged roll-outs, which can be customized according to your distribution strategy. Remember, when you submit your application for distribution, you must adhere to the respective app store's policy and content guidelines.
