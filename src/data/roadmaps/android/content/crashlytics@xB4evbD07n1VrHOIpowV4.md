# Crashlytics

`Crashlytics` is a lightweight, real-time crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that dismantle your app's quality. It delivers fast and precise information about crashes and helps you gain insights into your app's performance so you can pinpoint the exact line of code your app crashed on. Crashlytics offers a comprehensive suite of features like crash analysis, issue aggregation, and tracking user activities that led to a crash. This tool is now a part of Google's `Firebase` platform but can also be used independently.
