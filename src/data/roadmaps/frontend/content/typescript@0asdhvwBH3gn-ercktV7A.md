# TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language that builds upon JavaScript by adding optional static typing and other features. Developed and maintained by Microsoft, it compiles to plain JavaScript, allowing it to run in any environment that supports JavaScript. TypeScript offers enhanced IDE support with better code completion, refactoring, and error detection during development. It introduces concepts like interfaces, generics, and decorators, enabling more robust software architecture. TypeScript is particularly valuable for large-scale applications, as it improves code maintainability and readability. Its type system helps catch errors early in the development process, reducing runtime errors. With its growing ecosystem and adoption in popular frameworks like Angular, TypeScript has become a standard tool in modern web development.
