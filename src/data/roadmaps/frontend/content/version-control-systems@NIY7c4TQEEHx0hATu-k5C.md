# Version Control Systems

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help developers track and manage changes to code over time. They allow multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, maintaining a history of modifications. Git is the most popular VCS, known for its distributed nature and branching model. Other systems include Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial. VCS enables features like branching for parallel development, merging to combine changes, and reverting to previous states. They facilitate collaboration through remote repositories, pull requests, and code reviews. VCS also provides backup and recovery capabilities, conflict resolution, and the ability to tag specific points in history. By maintaining a detailed record of changes and supporting non-linear development, VCS has become an essential tool in modern software development, enhancing productivity, code quality, and team collaboration.
