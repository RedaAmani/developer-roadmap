# Mobile applications

Mobile applications are software programs designed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. They are typically distributed through app stores like Google Play or Apple's App Store. Mobile apps can be native (built specifically for one platform using languages like Swift for iOS or Kotlin for Android), hybrid (web technologies wrapped in a native container), or cross-platform (using frameworks like React Native or Flutter). These apps leverage device-specific features such as GPS, cameras, and sensors to provide rich, interactive experiences. They cover a wide range of functions from productivity and entertainment to social networking and e-commerce. Mobile app development considers factors like user interface design, performance optimization, offline functionality, and security to ensure a smooth user experience across various devices and operating systems.
