# Angular

Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It uses TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, to build scalable and efficient single-page applications (SPAs). Angular follows a component-based architecture, where the user interface is composed of reusable, self-contained components. The framework provides features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a powerful template syntax, which simplify the development of complex web applications. Angular also includes a comprehensive set of tools for testing, routing, and state management, making it a full-fledged solution for front-end development. Its modular structure and emphasis on best practices make it particularly suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.
