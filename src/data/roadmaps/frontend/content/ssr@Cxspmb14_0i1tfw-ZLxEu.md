# Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully rendered HTML. This approach contrasts with client-side rendering, where the browser builds the page using JavaScript. SSR improves initial page load time and search engine optimization (SEO) by providing complete content to crawlers. It's particularly beneficial for content-heavy sites and applications requiring fast first-page loads. SSR can be implemented with various frameworks like Next.js for React or Nuxt.js for Vue.js. While it can increase server load and complexity, SSR offers advantages in performance perception, especially on slower devices or networks, and can be combined with client-side hydration for dynamic interactivity after initial load.
