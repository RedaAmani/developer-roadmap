# OWASP Security Risks

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) identifies and ranks the most critical security risks to web applications. The OWASP Top 10 list includes vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XML external entities (XXE), broken access control, security misconfigurations, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, using components with known vulnerabilities, and insufficient logging and monitoring. These risks represent common attack vectors exploited by malicious actors to compromise web applications and their underlying systems. OWASP provides guidelines and best practices for mitigating these risks, emphasizing the importance of secure coding practices, regular security assessments, and implementing robust security controls throughout the software development lifecycle. Understanding and addressing these risks is crucial for developers and organizations to enhance the security posture of their web applications.
