# Module Bundlers

Module bundlers are development tools that combine multiple JavaScript files and their dependencies into a single file, optimized for web browsers. They resolve and manage dependencies, transform and optimize code, and often support features like code splitting and lazy loading. Popular module bundlers include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel. These tools address challenges in managing complex JavaScript applications by organizing code into modules, eliminating global scope pollution, and improving load times. Bundlers typically support various file formats, enable the use of modern JavaScript features through transpilation, and integrate with task runners and other build tools. Their primary goal is to streamline the development process and enhance application performance in production environments.
