# Linters formatters

Linters and formatters are tools used in software development to improve code quality and consistency. Linters analyze source code to detect programming errors, bugs, stylistic issues, and suspicious constructs, often enforcing a set of predefined or custom rules. Formatters automatically restructure code to adhere to a consistent style, adjusting elements like indentation, line breaks, and spacing. Together, these tools help maintain code standards across projects and teams, enhance readability, catch potential errors early, and reduce the cognitive load on developers during code reviews. Popular examples include ESLint for JavaScript linting and Prettier for code formatting, both of which can be integrated into development workflows and IDEs for real-time feedback and automatic corrections.
