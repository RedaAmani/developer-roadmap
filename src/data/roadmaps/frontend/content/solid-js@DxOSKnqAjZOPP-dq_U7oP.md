# SolidJS

SolidJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a fine-grained reactivity system that updates only what changes, resulting in high performance. SolidJS compiles templates to real DOM nodes and updates them in-place, avoiding the overhead of a virtual DOM. It offers a syntax similar to React, making it familiar to many developers, but with a different underlying mechanism. SolidJS supports JSX, provides built-in state management, and emphasizes composition over inheritance. Its small size and lack of runtime overhead make it particularly suitable for applications requiring high performance. While newer compared to some frameworks, SolidJS is gaining popularity for its simplicity, performance, and developer-friendly approach to reactive programming.
