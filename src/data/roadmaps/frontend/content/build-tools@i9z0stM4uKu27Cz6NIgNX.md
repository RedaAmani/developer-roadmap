# Build Tools

Build tools are software utilities designed to automate the process of creating executable applications from source code. They handle tasks such as compiling, linking, minifying, and bundling code, as well as running tests and managing dependencies. Common build tools include Make, Gradle, Maven, Webpack, and Gulp. These tools streamline development workflows by reducing manual steps, ensuring consistency across different environments, and optimizing output for production. They often support features like incremental builds, parallel processing, and custom task definitions. Build tools are crucial in modern software development, especially for large-scale projects, as they improve efficiency, reduce errors, and facilitate continuous integration and deployment processes.
