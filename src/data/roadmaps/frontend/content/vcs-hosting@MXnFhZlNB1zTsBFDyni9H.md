# Repo Hosting Services

Repo hosting services provide platforms for storing, managing, and collaborating on software projects using version control systems, primarily Git. These services offer features like issue tracking, pull requests, code review tools, wikis, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Popular platforms include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and SourceForge, each with unique offerings. GitHub, owned by Microsoft, is the largest and most widely used, known for its open-source community. GitLab offers a complete DevOps platform with built-in CI/CD. Bitbucket, part of Atlassian's suite, integrates well with other Atlassian tools. These services facilitate team collaboration, code sharing, and project management, making them integral to modern software development workflows. They also often provide features like access control, branch protection, and integration with various development tools, enhancing the overall development process.
