# Hosting

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. It involves storing website files on powerful computers called servers, which are connected to a high-speed network. When users enter a domain name in their browser, the web host serves the website's content. Hosting services range from shared hosting (where multiple websites share server resources) to dedicated hosting (where a server is exclusively used by one client). Other types include VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting, cloud hosting, and managed WordPress hosting. Web hosts typically provide additional services such as email hosting, domain registration, SSL certificates, and technical support. The choice of web hosting impacts a website's performance, security, and scalability, making it a crucial decision for any online presence.
