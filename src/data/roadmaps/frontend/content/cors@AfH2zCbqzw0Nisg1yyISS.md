# CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to control access to resources (like APIs or fonts) on a web page from a different domain than the one serving the web page. It extends and adds flexibility to the Same-Origin Policy, allowing servers to specify who can access their resources. CORS works through a system of HTTP headers, where browsers send a preflight request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, and the server responds with headers indicating whether the actual request is allowed. This mechanism helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data while enabling legitimate cross-origin requests. CORS is crucial for modern web applications that often integrate services and resources from multiple domains, balancing security needs with the functionality requirements of complex, distributed web systems.
