# Domain Name

A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify and access websites on the internet. It serves as a more memorable alternative to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to locate web servers. Domain names consist of two main parts: the second-level domain (usually the website or organization name) and the top-level domain (such as .com, .org, or .net). They are registered through domain registrars and must be unique within their top-level domain. Domain names are crucial for branding, marketing, and establishing an online presence. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites by typing in familiar names rather than complex number sequences. Domain names can be customized, transferred, and renewed, playing a vital role in the structure and accessibility of the World Wide Web.
