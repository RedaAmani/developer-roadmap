# Shadow DOM

The Shadow DOM is a web standard that provides encapsulation for JavaScript, CSS, and templating in web components. It allows developers to create isolated DOM trees within elements, separate from the main document DOM. This encapsulation prevents styles and scripts from leaking in or out, ensuring that component internals remain separate from the rest of the page. Shadow DOM enables more modular and maintainable code by reducing naming conflicts and CSS specificity issues. It's particularly useful for creating reusable custom elements with self-contained styling and behavior. While primarily used in web components, Shadow DOM can also be leveraged in various scenarios to improve code organization and reduce unintended side effects in complex web applications.
