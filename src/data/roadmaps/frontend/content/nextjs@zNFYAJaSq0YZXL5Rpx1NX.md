# Next.js

Next.js is a React-based open-source framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. It provides features like automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and simplified routing out of the box. Next.js supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), allowing developers to choose the most appropriate rendering method for each page. The framework offers built-in CSS support, API routes for backend functionality, and easy deployment options. Next.js is known for its developer-friendly experience, with features like hot module replacement and automatic prefetching. Its ability to create hybrid apps that combine static and server-rendered pages makes it popular for building scalable, SEO-friendly web applications.
