# React

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, it allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render as data changes. React uses a virtual DOM for performance optimization and supports a unidirectional data flow. Its component-based architecture promotes modularity and reusability. React's ecosystem includes tools like Redux for state management and React Native for mobile app development. The library's declarative nature, efficient rendering, and strong community support have made it one of the most popular choices for front-end development in modern web applications.
