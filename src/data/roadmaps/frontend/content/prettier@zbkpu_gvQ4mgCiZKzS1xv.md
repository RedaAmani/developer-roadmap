# Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and more. It automatically formats code to adhere to a consistent style, eliminating debates about code formatting in development teams. Prettier parses code and reprints it with its own rules, taking maximum line length into account and wrapping code when necessary. It integrates with most editors and can be run as part of the development workflow or in pre-commit hooks. Prettier's main benefits include saving time on code reviews, reducing cognitive load for developers, and maintaining a consistent code style across projects. Its "zero-config" philosophy and wide language support have made it a popular tool in modern development environments.
