# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. It offers a highly customizable set of pre-defined classes for layout, typography, color, and more, allowing rapid UI development. Tailwind emphasizes flexibility and composability, enabling developers to create unique designs without writing custom CSS. It uses a mobile-first approach and includes a built-in purge feature to remove unused styles in production, resulting in smaller file sizes. Tailwind's philosophy promotes consistency in design while maintaining the freedom to create custom looks. Its popularity has grown due to its efficiency in prototyping and building responsive designs quickly.
