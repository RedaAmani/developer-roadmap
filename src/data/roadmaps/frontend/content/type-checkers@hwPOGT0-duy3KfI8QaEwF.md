# Type Checkers

Type checkers are tools that analyze code to detect and prevent type-related errors without executing the program. They enforce type consistency, helping developers catch mistakes early in the development process. Popular type checkers include TypeScript for JavaScript, Flow for JavaScript, and mypy for Python. These tools add static typing to dynamically typed languages, offering benefits like improved code reliability, better documentation, and enhanced developer tooling support. Type checkers can infer types in many cases and allow for gradual adoption in existing projects. They help prevent common runtime errors, facilitate refactoring, and improve code maintainability. While adding some overhead to the development process, type checkers are widely adopted in large-scale applications for their ability to catch errors before runtime and improve overall code quality.
