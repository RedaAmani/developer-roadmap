# react-router

React Router is a popular routing library for React applications that enables dynamic, client-side routing. It allows developers to create single-page applications with multiple views, managing the URL and history of the browser while keeping the UI in sync with the URL. React Router provides a declarative way to define routes, supporting nested routes, route parameters, and programmatic navigation. It offers components like BrowserRouter, Route, and Link to handle routing logic and navigation. The library also supports features such as lazy loading of components, route guards, and custom history management. React Router's integration with React's component model makes it a go-to solution for managing navigation and creating complex, multi-view applications in React ecosystems.
