# Modern CSS

Modern CSS emphasizes responsive design with techniques like media queries and fluid typography. It also includes methodologies like CSS-in-JS and utility-first frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS). Features such as CSS Logical Properties improve internationalization, while CSS Houdini allows for more powerful custom styling. Modern CSS focuses on performance optimization, maintainability, and creating adaptive, accessible designs across various devices and screen sizes, significantly improving the capabilities and efficiency of web styling.
