# React Native

React Native is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Facebook. It allows developers to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. React Native translates JavaScript code into native components, providing near-native performance and a genuine native user interface. It enables code reuse across platforms, speeding up development and reducing costs. The framework offers hot reloading for quick iterations, access to native APIs, and a large ecosystem of third-party plugins. React Native's "learn once, write anywhere" philosophy and its ability to bridge web and mobile development make it popular for creating cross-platform mobile applications, especially among teams already familiar with React for web development.
