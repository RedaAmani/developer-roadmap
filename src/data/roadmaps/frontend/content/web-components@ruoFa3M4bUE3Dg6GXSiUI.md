# Web Components

Web Components are a set of standardized browser technologies that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated HTML elements for web pages and applications. They consist of three main technologies: Custom Elements for defining new HTML tags, Shadow DOM for encapsulating styles and markup, and HTML Templates for declaring fragments of reusable HTML. Web Components enable the creation of modular, shareable components that work across different frameworks and browsers. They provide strong encapsulation, reducing style conflicts and promoting code reuse. While adoption has been slower compared to popular JavaScript frameworks, Web Components offer a standards-based approach to component development, ensuring long-term compatibility and interoperability in web ecosystems.
