# Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Flutter's architecture allows for fast development with hot reload, enabling developers to see changes instantly. It supports iOS, Android, web, and desktop platforms, offering true cross-platform development. Flutter uses a custom rendering engine, Skia, to draw UI components, ensuring consistent appearance across devices. While known for mobile app development, Flutter's expanding ecosystem and performance improvements have increased its adoption for web and desktop applications as well.
