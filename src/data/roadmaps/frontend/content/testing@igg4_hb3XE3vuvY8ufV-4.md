# Testing your apps

Testing apps involves systematically evaluating software to ensure it meets requirements, functions correctly, and maintains quality. Key testing types include:

1. Unit testing: Verifying individual components or functions
2. Integration testing: Checking interactions between different parts of the app
3. Functional testing: Ensuring the app meets specified requirements
4. UI/UX testing: Evaluating the user interface and experience
5. Performance testing: Assessing app speed, responsiveness, and stability
6. Security testing: Identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring data protection
7. Accessibility testing: Verifying usability for people with disabilities
8. Compatibility testing: Checking functionality across different devices and platforms

Modern testing often incorporates automated testing tools and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) are popular methodologies that emphasize writing tests before or alongside code. Effective testing strategies help identify bugs early, improve code quality, and ensure a reliable user experience.
