# Qwik

Qwik is an open-source front-end framework designed for optimal performance and near-instant loading of web applications. It focuses on delivering a "resumable" application model, where the app can start running with minimal JavaScript downloaded. Qwik achieves this through fine-grained lazy loading, serialization of the application state, and prefetching. It uses a unique approach to hydration, only loading JavaScript for interactive elements when needed. Qwik is built for modern web standards and aims to solve performance issues common in large-scale web applications. While still relatively new compared to established frameworks, Qwik's innovative approach to performance optimization is garnering attention in the web development community.
