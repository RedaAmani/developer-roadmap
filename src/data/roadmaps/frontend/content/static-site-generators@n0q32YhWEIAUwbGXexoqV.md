# Static Site Generators

Static site generators (SSGs) are tools that create HTML websites from raw data and templates, producing pre-rendered pages at build time rather than at runtime. They combine the benefits of static websites (speed, security, simplicity) with the flexibility of dynamic sites. SSGs typically use markup languages like Markdown for content, templating engines for layouts, and generate a fully static website that can be hosted on simple web servers or content delivery networks. Popular SSGs include Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, and Eleventy. They're well-suited for blogs, documentation sites, and content-focused websites. SSGs offer advantages in performance, version control integration, and reduced server-side complexity, making them increasingly popular for a wide range of web projects.
