# SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)

The Speedy Web Compiler (SWC) is a fast, extensible JavaScript/TypeScript compiler written in Rust. It's designed as a faster alternative to Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript code into backwards-compatible versions. SWC can be used for both compilation and bundling, offering significant performance improvements over traditional JavaScript-based tools. It supports latest ECMAScript features, JSX, and TypeScript, and can be configured for custom transformations. SWC is commonly used in development environments to speed up build times and in production builds to optimize code. Its speed and compatibility make it increasingly popular in large-scale JavaScript projects and as a core component in other build tools and frameworks aiming for improved performance.
