# pnpm

pnpm (performant npm) is a fast, disk-space efficient package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects. It addresses inefficiencies in npm and Yarn by using a unique approach to storing and linking dependencies. pnpm creates a single, global store for all packages and uses hard links to reference them in project node_modules, significantly reducing disk space usage and installation time. It strictly adheres to package.json specifications, ensuring consistent installs across environments. pnpm offers features like workspace support for monorepos, side-by-side versioning, and improved security through better isolation of dependencies. While less widely adopted than npm or Yarn, pnpm's performance benefits and efficient disk usage are attracting increasing attention in the JavaScript community.
