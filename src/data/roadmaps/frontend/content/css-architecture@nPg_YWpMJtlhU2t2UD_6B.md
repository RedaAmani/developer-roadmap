# CSS Architecture

CSS architecture refers to the methodologies and organizational strategies used to structure and maintain CSS code in large-scale web projects. It focuses on creating scalable, maintainable, and modular stylesheets to manage the growing complexity of web applications. Key concepts include naming conventions (like BEM or SMACSS), component-based design, separation of concerns, and the use of preprocessors (such as Sass or Less). CSS architecture often employs techniques like CSS modules, utility classes, or CSS-in-JS solutions to improve code reusability and reduce specificity conflicts. The goal is to create a systematic approach to styling that enhances collaboration among developers, reduces code duplication, and facilitates easier updates and maintenance of the visual design across an entire application or website.
