# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is an approach to web development that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. It uses fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries to adapt the layout to the viewing environment. The goal is to build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and change the layout accordingly, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones. This approach eliminates the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market, while ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience across all devices.
