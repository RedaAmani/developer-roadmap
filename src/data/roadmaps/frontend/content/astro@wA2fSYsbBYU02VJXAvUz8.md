# Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator (SSG) and web framework designed for building fast, content-focused websites. It allows developers to use multiple frontend frameworks (like React, Vue, or Svelte) within the same project, automatically rendering components to static HTML at build time. Astro's unique "partial hydration" approach only sends JavaScript to the browser when necessary, resulting in significantly smaller bundle sizes and faster load times. The framework supports file-based routing, markdown content, and built-in optimizations for images and assets. Astro's component islands architecture enables developers to create interactive components while maintaining the performance benefits of static HTML, making it particularly well-suited for content-rich sites like blogs, documentation, and marketing pages.
