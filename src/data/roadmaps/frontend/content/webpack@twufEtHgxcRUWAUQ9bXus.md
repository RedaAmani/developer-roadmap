# Webpack

Webpack is a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler that transforms, bundles, or packages resources for the web. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Webpack can handle not just JavaScript, but also other assets like CSS, images, and fonts. It uses loaders to preprocess files and plugins to perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization. Webpack's key features include code splitting, lazy loading, and a rich ecosystem of extensions. It supports hot module replacement for faster development and tree shaking to eliminate unused code. While it has a steeper learning curve compared to some alternatives, Webpack's flexibility and powerful features make it a standard tool in many modern JavaScript development workflows, especially for complex applications.
