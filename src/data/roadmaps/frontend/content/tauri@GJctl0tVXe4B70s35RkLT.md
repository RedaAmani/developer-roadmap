# Tauri

Tauri is an open-source framework for building lightweight, secure desktop applications using web technologies. It allows developers to create cross-platform apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while using a Rust backend for core functionality. Tauri offers smaller bundle sizes compared to Electron, as it leverages the operating system's native webview instead of bundling Chromium. It provides robust security features, including a custom protocol for IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and fine-grained permissions. Tauri supports multiple JavaScript frameworks and offers API bindings for various system-level operations. Its emphasis on performance, security, and small binary sizes makes it an attractive option for developers seeking to create efficient desktop applications with web technologies.
