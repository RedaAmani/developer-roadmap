# Data Pipelines

Data pipelines are a series of automated processes that transport and transform data from various sources to a destination for analysis or storage. They typically involve steps like data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading (ETL) into databases, data lakes, or warehouses. Pipelines can handle batch or real-time data, ensuring that large-scale datasets are processed efficiently and consistently. They play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and enabling businesses to derive insights from raw data for reporting, analytics, or machine learning.
