# Bash

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a Unix shell and command language used for interacting with the operating system through a terminal. It allows users to execute commands, automate tasks via scripting, and manage system operations. As the default shell for many Linux distributions, it supports command-line utilities, file manipulation, process control, and text processing. Bash scripts can include loops, conditionals, and functions, making it a powerful tool for system administration, automation, and task scheduling.
