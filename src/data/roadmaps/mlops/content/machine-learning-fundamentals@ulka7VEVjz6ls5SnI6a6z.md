# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning fundamentals encompass the key concepts and techniques that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. At its core, machine learning involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and improve over time with experience. Key areas include supervised learning (where models are trained on labeled data), unsupervised learning (where models identify patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (where agents learn to make decisions based on feedback from their actions). Essential components also include data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation metrics, and the importance of avoiding overfitting. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for developing effective machine learning applications across various domains.
