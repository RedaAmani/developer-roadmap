# Git

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing versions of code, allowing for branching, merging, and tracking of revisions. Git ensures that changes are recorded with a complete history, enabling rollback to previous versions if necessary. It supports distributed workflows, meaning each developer has a complete local copy of the projectâ€™s history, facilitating seamless collaboration, conflict resolution, and efficient management of code across different teams or environments.
