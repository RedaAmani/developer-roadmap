# Cloud Computing

**Cloud Computing** refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet rather than using local servers or personal devices. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud Computing enables faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. There are various types of cloud computing such as public clouds, private clouds, and hybrids clouds. Furthermore, it's divided into different services like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These services differ mainly in the level of control an organization has over their data and infrastructures.
