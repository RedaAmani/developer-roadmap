# DEL

The `DEL` command in Redis is used to delete one or more keys from the database. If the specified key(s) exist, they are removed, and the command returns the number of keys that were deleted. If a key does not exist, it is simply ignored, and no error is returned. This command is useful for managing memory by removing unnecessary or obsolete data and is an atomic operation, ensuring that keys are deleted without interference from other operations.
