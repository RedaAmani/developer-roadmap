# GEOADD

The `GEOADD` command in Redis is used to add geospatial data to a sorted set, where each entry consists of a member (a unique identifier) and its corresponding longitude and latitude coordinates. This command allows you to store location-based data efficiently, enabling geospatial queries such as finding members within a specified radius or calculating distances between points. The coordinates are stored in a format that allows for quick retrieval and analysis, making `GEOADD` a powerful tool for applications involving mapping, location tracking, and proximity searches.
