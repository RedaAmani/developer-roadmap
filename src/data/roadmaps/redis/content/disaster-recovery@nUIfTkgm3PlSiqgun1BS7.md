# Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery in Redis involves strategies and practices to ensure data availability and integrity in the event of failures, such as server crashes, data corruption, or network issues. Key approaches include leveraging Redis's built-in replication, where data is copied from master to replica nodes for redundancy. Snapshots (RDB) and append-only file (AOF) persistence methods can be configured for data recovery, allowing the restoration of data to a recent state. Additionally, implementing a Redis Cluster can provide automated failover capabilities, distributing data across multiple nodes to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity. Regular backups and monitoring are also essential components of a robust disaster recovery plan.
