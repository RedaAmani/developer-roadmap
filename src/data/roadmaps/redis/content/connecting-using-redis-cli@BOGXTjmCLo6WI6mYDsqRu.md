# Connecting using Redis CLI

The Redis CLI (`redis-cli`) is a command-line interface used to interact with a Redis server. It allows users to run Redis commands, monitor the server, manage data, and perform administrative tasks. Common operations include setting and getting keys, managing key expiration, and checking server status. The CLI supports running commands in both interactive mode and non-interactive mode for scripting and automation. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for developers and administrators to troubleshoot and manage Redis instances directly.
