# BITOP

The `BITOP` command in Redis performs bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, and NOT) across one or more string keys, treating the strings as binary data. The result is stored in a destination key. This command is useful for manipulating and analyzing binary data directly in Redis, such as when aggregating flags or working with bitmap data structures.
