# EXPIRE

The EXPIRE command is used to set a time-to-live (TTL) for a key in seconds, after which the key will be automatically deleted. If you need to specify the expiration time in milliseconds, you can use the PEXPIRE command. Both commands help manage memory by allowing you to automatically remove keys that are no longer needed, which is especially useful in caching and session management scenarios.
