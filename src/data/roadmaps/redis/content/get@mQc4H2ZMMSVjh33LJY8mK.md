# GET

The `GET` command in Redis is used to retrieve the value associated with a specified key. If the key exists, it returns the value as a string; if the key does not exist, it returns a nil response. This command is fundamental for accessing stored data in Redis and is often used in conjunction with other commands to manipulate and manage data within the database. The `GET` command is atomic, meaning it provides a consistent view of the data at the time the command is executed.
