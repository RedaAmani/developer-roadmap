Of course, the choice of React is mine, and mine alone. You have to consider your own projects and your own context to understand what the best choice for you would be.

Let’s get into the selection and what their strengths and weaknesses are to help you select the right one for you.

## Top 7 Frontend Development Frameworks in 2024

### React

![React](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/react-logo-d5ice.png)

React was created by Facebook in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular frontend frameworks (though technically a library). Initially developed to solve the challenges of building dynamic and complex user interfaces for Facebook’s apps, React introduced the revolutionary concept of the virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which allowed developers to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that changed instead of re-rendering the entire page.

#### Performance

React uses a virtual DOM (the Virtual Document Object Model) to optimize performance by minimizing the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM. This allows React to efficiently update only the components that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire page. While React is fast, performance can be impacted in large applications if not managed carefully, especially with unnecessary re-renders or poorly optimized state management (two concepts that have created a lot of literature around them, and yet, most developers still get wrong).
